        <p class="cool-style">
            Second p element in first div child
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <ul>
            <li>
                First li element in second div child
            </li>
            <li>
                Second li element in second div child
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Li element in third div child
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="cool-style">
            P element in third div child
        </p>
    </div>
</div>

```
Describe the hierarchy to the person sitting next to you. Draw a visual representation of the hierarchy

Create an external main.css file and add a reference in the index.html.
Do not add ids or classes to the tags. Now add the following specific styles:

- select all elements. Add blue font color
- select all li elements. Add red font color
- select the second p element in the first div child. Add green color to the font. Hint: use the nth-child selector 
- select the li element in the third div child. remove the dot
- select the elements that have a class of 'cool-style'. Add some cool styling. 


Now add your own improved styles so the hierarchy becomes visible/obvious to the viewer.
